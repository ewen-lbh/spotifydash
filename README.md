# spotifydash

> A dashboard with some spotify features I wish the official client had

A UI Prototype is available at <https://design.penpot.app/#/view/6aa120d0-c0aa-11eb-b700-c13c371b4289/6aa120d1-c0aa-11eb-b700-c13c371b4289?token=Wklpv2aawSCLjkLS6zo3Mw&index=0>

The website is deployed to <https://spotifydash.surge.sh>. I might get a real domain name.

Needed
======

- Spotify API OAuth
- Vibrant colors extraction
