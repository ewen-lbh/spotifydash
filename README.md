# subfeed for spotify

> A feed of releases from artists you follow, and a list of suggested artists you might want to follow becase you liked a bunch of tracks from them

A UI Prototype is available at <https://design.penpot.app/#/view/6aa120d0-c0aa-11eb-b700-c13c371b4289/6aa120d1-c0aa-11eb-b700-c13c371b4289?token=Wklpv2aawSCLjkLS6zo3Mw&index=0>

The website is deployed to <https://subfeed-for-spotify.surge.sh>. I might get a real domain name.
